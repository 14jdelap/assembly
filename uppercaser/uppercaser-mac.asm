    ; ====================
    ; = What's argv[][]? =
    ; ====================
    ;
    ; In C a string is an array of characters (i.e. char[])
    ; Thus, an array of strings is an array of arrays (i.e. char[][])
    ; This is why CLI are passed as arrays of strings, which in C is named argv[][]
    ;
    ; In assembly an array is a _memory address_ pointing to the first element in the array
    ;
    ; For example, if you had an array of integers that looked like this:
    ; +-----------+-----+
    ; |  address  | val |
    ; +-----------+-----|
    ; | 0x03a8000 | 919 |
    ; | 0x03a8040 |  30 |
    ; | 0x03a8080 | 245 |
    ; | 0x03a80c0 | 689 |
    ; +-----------+-----|
    ; The array would be represented by its first address: 0x03a8000
    ; To read the array you'd need to ask the computer for the value stored in that address (e.g. 0x03a8000 has the value 919)
    ;
    ; In assembly you follow an address into memory by surrounding it with []s
    ; rcx has you access the address in the rcx registry
    ; [rcx] has you access the value stored in MEMORY by the address in rcx
    ;
    ; When we follow addresses into memory we need to tell the computer the size of the data we want back
    ; In 64 bit computers we need to ask for qword (64 bit words) back, 32-bit words would be dword [rcx] and single bytes would be byte [rcx]
    ;
    ; Below we move the value of rcx into the syscall so that it can write it through the syscall when calling .print
    ; We add 8 bytes to [rcx] to skip 1 word and proceed to the next argument, which is the 1st user argument
    mov rbx, qword [rcx + 8]

    push rbx
    push rbx

    ; Iterate over characters to i) calculate string length and ii) uppercase letters
    call .iterate

    ; By convention function return values are in rax, so .strLen shouldÂ´ve put the string's length into rax
    ; Here we move the value to rdx so .print can use it
    mov rdx, rax

    ; Pop the memory address of the CL argument back into rsi so the sys_call syscall gets to it
    pop rsi

    ; Print the CL argument
    call .print

    ret

  ; Iterate over characters, calculate the string's length to dynamically print it and uppercase it
  .iterate:
    pop rbx ; return memory address
    pop rsi ; argument string into rsi
    push rbx

    ; Get the string length by iterating over characters in memory until hitting the null (0) byte
    ; Character arrays terminate when you hit 0

    ; rax will hold the string length counter, which will increment as we run through the string
    mov rax, -1

    ; Loop over each character in the string
    .iterateLoop:
      inc rax ; always increments, hence why rax starts at -1 -> opportunity to re-factor so rax starts at 0?

      ; Check if the current character is null byte (0)
      ; rsi is a pointer to the first character in the string
      ; rax is the number of characters we've looked at so far (0 in 1st iteration, 1 in 2nd, etc)
      ; rsi + rax is the memory address of the current character we're iterating through
      ; - rsi + 0 is the first character
      ; - rsi + 1 is the second character
      ; and having them in [rsi + rax] means we access their value in memory rather than the pointer
      ; We write it as `byte [rsi, rax]` because characters are 1 byte, so we specify that type
      cmp byte [rsi + rax], 0

      ; jz (jump if zero) jumps if the ZF is true?
      ; .return is an early return statement
      jz .return

      call .uppercase
      call .iterateLoop

    .uppercase:
      ; Check if the current character can be a lowercase letter (they start at 97)
      cmp byte [rsi + rax], 97

      ; jl (jump if lower) means that if the character is less than 97 it returns early
      jl .return

      ; Compare and return early if the byte is not within the bounds of a lowercase letter
      cmp byte [rsi + rax], 122
      jg .return

      ; Subtract 32 from rsi + rax to lowercase the letter
      sub byte [rsi + rax], 32

      ; QUESTION!!!: where is the return value stored?
      ret


.print:
  mov rax, 0x2000004 ; write syscall
